# Snake-Game-
Built a Snake Game using Turtle Library in Python. The snake is controlled using the four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in. Our objective in the game is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits. The player loses once the snake hits the wall or hits itself.
